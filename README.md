# WebProgramming_FormValidation

The project is to create a form validation system for a website. The system should validate user input for various fields such as name, last name, email, phone number, user ID, and reference code. The validation should be performed as the user moves focus from one field to the next, and should include the following constraints:

All fields are required.
First name and last name must contain only letters.
User ID and reference code can be any valid string.
Dropdown lists must have at least three valid options and a default invalid option.
Icons should be used to enhance the visual aspects of the validation.
Invalid fields should be visually indicated.
On submission, the form should redisplay all invalid fields and indicate their errors.
If all fields are valid, the form should submit the information and display a summary of the entered data.
